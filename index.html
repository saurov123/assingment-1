                          <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
               
                           Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention. Older people and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age. </p>

                           Keep physical distance of at least 1 metre from others, even if they don’t appear to be sick. Avoid crowds and close contact.
                           Wear a properly fitted mask when physical distancing is not possible and in poorly ventilated settings.
                           Clean your hands frequently with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.
                           Cover your mouth and nose with a bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Dispose of used tissues immediately and clean hands regularly. 
                           If you develop symptoms or test positive for COVID-19, self-isolate until you recover.</p>
